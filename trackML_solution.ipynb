    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We use sparse binning to perform ultrafast clustering. Tracks are first chosen according to their length, and later are scored and merged using a Machine Learning (=ML) algorithm. At the final stage the tracks are expanded by adding the closest hits to the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The biggest advantage of using clustering by sparse binning is speed**. This method can score 0.5 in just 40 sec using python on a single core, and it could be much faster if it was written in C++ and even faster by using paralleling on CPU or GPU. **The computational complexity of the clustering part in the algorithm is O(N)**. The feature calculation and binning can be done for every hit independently of the other hits and all hits are needed only for counting the number of hits in every bin. (The Python implementation uses np.unique which is actually O(NlogN)  ). We believe that with a careful implementation in C++  a score of 0.5 can be achieved in less than 10 seconds, allowing this algorithm to be an essential step in every fast algorithm (we will explain this statement later).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second stage in the algorithm is ML merging. The fastest way to merge 2 solutions is by assigning to each hit the track with the highest number of hits. This method is used in the clustering main loop. However, this method is limited because the number of hits is not always a good indication for a good track. The ML algorithm uses various features which describe the track and is able to distinguish between good and bad tracks. Unlike other ML solutions presented in Kaggle, our ML algorithm does not check the helix itself, as the clustering part already takes care of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part in the algorithm is quite straightforward: track expanding is done by choosing the long tracks and adding to these tracks the closest loose hits (i.e. hits from short tracks). \n",
    "\n",
    "The full solution is then: \n",
    "•\tRun clustering a few times\n",
    "•\tUse ML to merge\n",
    "•\tExpand \n",
    "\n",
    "In the solution we submitted we used about 7 runs of clustering, using 100000 loop iterations each, merged and expanded twice (The 2nd time was just to add about 0.003 to the score by using a loophole in the definition of the competition metric [(1)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification/discussion/60638#354053)) \n"

    "The basic idea of clustering it to relate to every hit a set of numbers (features) and then to group hits with close feature together.\n",

    "### Features \n",
    "Due to the magnetic field in the experiment, the particles form helixes, which travel along the z-axis. Each hit in the x-y-z space can be the member of any particular helix in a certain family of helixes. The idea of the algorithm is to go over each possible member of this family of helixes, and look at how many of all hits may belong to this particular member. The hits are then assigned to the helix (=track) with the most possible hits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by assuming the particle is formed in a small cylinder around the origin i.e. the approximate starting point of the helix is '(0,0,z0)'. (According to the introduction papers '|z0|<5.5mm').\n",

    "### Sparse Binning Clustering\n",
    "Binning is the easiest way to cluster, in this method we divide the values of each feature to constant areas and a cluster is formed by all the hits whos features are all in the same area. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, if we have one feature in the range `[-1,1]` we can decide to divide it to 20 equal bins of size `0.1: [-1,-0.9), [-0.9,0.8), …,[0.9,1]`. We will assign every bin a number 0 , …, 19 and define the hit’s feature with this value. If we have 3 features for a hit we will define that hit with the 3 values of bins. As an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "Hit #1 – (12,15,0)\n",
    "Hit #2 – (11,5,2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Two hits which have the exact 3 values, are clustered together to form track candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the bins don’t have to spread uniformly, and every feature can have a different number of bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sparse Binning we use a very simple binning algorithm. We start by using uniform spread bins which can be easily calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "For feature `F1` in the range `[-1,1]` we define `B1 = int(F1*k1)` where the number of bins is `2*k1`\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. we multiply the feature by half the number of bins and take the integer part.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine few features together and get the cluster id (track_id) we just offset each feature by multiplying it by a number which is big enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have 2 features F1, F2 and we want to have 2*k1, 2*k2 bins for each feature, we can define:\n",
    "\n",
    "` (a) Track_id = int(F1*k1) + (2*k1+1)*int(F2*k2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "And that’s it clustering is finished!!\n",
    "\n",
    "This calculation takes about 4mSec for 120,000 hits on Kaggle kernel platform compared to about 950mSec for dbscan which is the most popular clustering algorithm used by the competitors in the TrackML Challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of clustering moves the bottleneck of the full solution, form clustering to merging (will be discussed in the next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "One weakness of the binning algorithm is its sensitivity caused, among other things, by the hard boarders between bins. As an example, let’s take two hits:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "Hit1 – with features (-1e-7,0.1,0.3)\n",
    "Hit2 – with features (1e-7,0.1,0.3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the calculation above (1), Hit1, Hit2 will never cluster together no matter how many bins we’ll have.\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue is solved by adding a random number in the range `[0,1)` to every feature in the binning calculation, making (a):\n",
    "\n",
    "`(b) Track_id = int(F1*k1+r1) + (2*k1+1)*int(F2*k2+r2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where r1, r2 are random numbers with uniform distribution in the range `[0,1)`. r1, r2 are changed every time we cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "When compared to dbscan, sparse clustering has one big disadvantage, it’s sensitivity, it can miss some of the hits because they fall in another bin. This sensitivity is also its strength, as it doesn’t cluster many wrong hits (outliners) which degrade the maximum achievable score. \n"

    "\n",
    "If Hit #1 has track_id=1 in list #100 and track_id=10000002 in list #101 (the track_id’s in both lists should be completely different) and in list #100 there are 10 hits with track_id=1 while in list #101 there are 7 hits with track_id=10000002, hit#1 will choose track_id=1.\n",

(We can also reduce the amount of memory needed by hashing). \n",

Although there were some discussions on taking a similar approach [(4)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification/discussion/58323), we don’t know of anyone who implemented it. As far as we know, most ML implementations where in an effort to construct or expand the tracks. \n",

    "- Produce different submission candidates sub_1, sub_2, ..., sub_N\n",
    "- Create a machine learning model, which gives probabilities between 0 and 1 for each track candidate\n",
    "- Merge two submission candidates by assigning to each hit the track, which has higher probability\n",
    "- Merge all submission candidates to get the final submission. The merging can be done sequentially, as we did in our final submission \n",

    "The machine learning model we use is LightGBM. We chose 13 features per track:\n",
    "- variance of x,y,z (these are the most important)\n",
    "- minimum of x,y,z\n",
    "- maximum of x,y,z\n",

    "- number of clusters per track (i.e. are there many hits, which are close together?)\n",
    "- number of hits divided by number of clusters\n",
    "We tried many more features (e.g. number of different volumes crossed, means of x,y etc.), but we saw only negligible gains, probably because these features are closely related to the features we already use. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Training and validation\n",
    "The model was trained using 250 events from the training set. The true tracks (target=1) were selected using the truth file. The wrong tracks (target=0) were generated by first running the clustering algorithm on an event, and then picking all generated tracks, whose hits belonged to at least two different particles (particle_id). \n",

    "After the completion of the competition, we did another test where we merge 64 fast clustering solutions, using 1000 (z0,kt) pairs each (i.e. a total of 64000 pairs). The score we got after expanding, for train event 1000, was 0.782. We get a similar score, but with longer runtime, by our usual algorithm of clustering 100000 pairs expansion, which is slower. \n"

    "1.\tAs a full solution our approach can be easily optimized for speed:\n",

Farther improvement for real world application can be achieved by massively paralleling the feature calculation using a GPU (as we explained above, every hit is treated separately, which makes the algorithm very suitable for parallel processing).\n",
    "    -\tBoth the ML and the expanding algorithm where not optimized at all as they weren’t the bottleneck of the solution. As an example, the expanding algorithm recalculates the features for all the loose hits every time. Calculating the features only for hits with z>0 while expanding tracks with z>0 will immediately cut the running time of the algorithm by half. \n",
    "2.\tElements of our approach may be beneficial for any final solution to this problem.\n",
    "   - In particular, our binning algorithm creates a lot of good candidate tracks in a short period of time. It may be helpful to employ this at the beginning of a solution, in order to very quickly (<1 minute) detect 50% of all tracks (use small bins). One can then continue with running a different algorithm on the remaining hits.\n",
    "   - Similarly, the machine learning algorithm, as well as the employed parameters and track extension algorithm may improve any final result, while just adding minutes (or less, after optimization) to the total runtime.\n",
    "3.\tIn our algorithm we didn’t do any adjustments for uneven magnetic field. If we incorporate @CPMP’s findings [here (3)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification/discussion/63250#latest-372564). The score of the algorithm improves immediately by 0.02 to about 0.82. \n",
